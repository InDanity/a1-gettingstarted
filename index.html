    <h1>Information about Daniel Onyenma</h1>
    <p>
      I am a senior here at WPI and I have lived in Worcester my whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I major in Computer Science and am taking Operating Systems and basketball along with this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've taken Intro to CS, Discrete Maths, Algorithms, System Programming Concepts, Software Engineering, Foundations of Computer Science, Theory of Computation, and Social Imps before this class.
      I played the trumpet and baritone in high school (from 7th-12th grade and from 11th-12 grade respectively).
      Will beat you in Super Smash Brothers Ult.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I worked at the Blackstone Cinema as an Usher, was good for meeting new people and watching new movies upon release.
      For coding:
      HTML - Learned some from a Caleb Curry JS tutorial over this summer for no particular reason (very happy I did so now).
      CSS - Was mentioned in the above tutorial but only for 3 minutes of the 8 hours.
      Java - Was used in most of my prior classes, fairly familiar with it.
      JavaScript - Learned some from aformentioned tutorial.
      Ruby - Like the gem?
      Python - Used in some of my prior science classes and watched my brother learn it a bit. Beyond that, very little experience.
      Unit Testing - Did plenty of this in Software Engineering. That was over a year ago though...
